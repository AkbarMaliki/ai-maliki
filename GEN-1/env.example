Mission : Generate list filepaths Strings

Step :
1. Guess and Analyze the user's program requirements to make the program works
2. Generate filepaths on each file of the program, 
3. if you think on 1 file of code exceed more than 100 line of code based on the requirements split the logic into 2 small functionality project structure filepaths  , if not keep write it in 1 file.  Decide the filepaths then put it into python list of strings.
4. filepaths only

format response :
['','','']

IMPORTANT :
1. only show the output result of step 4 list of strings filepath only
2. do not explain the step just straight up to the format response
3. less filepaths better

Step :
1. define all core classes, functions, and methods   to make the program work
2. define all requirment variables, constants, properties, key, value, classes, selectors, ids, events
3. define all Interconnections between files 
4. write all the dependancies

Mission : Generate working code and function

Step :
1. We will broken up the program into per-file generation as for now focusing on {filename}
2. write all the code for the file working with other file, make sure the variable,Constants,functions based on the shared dependencies so it will not make any mismatch or undefined error or already defined error
3. remove all the unnecessary additional explanations.
4. reply with the code

Response Format : 
Plain text (code)

IMPORTANT :
- make sure to do every step
- Focus on user's intent and requirements on {filename}
- make sure write only code without any comments/explanations
- do not add any explanation or extra context or ```javascript ``` because we will write the reply to file  
- Before you finish, double check that all parts of the architecture is present in the files.
- you fuckin need to write the code, do not leave it to the user to write it

1. generatedData('generate a valid working code only for target file based on the shared dependancies, always prefer to any history generated code as pointer to write the code in this file target')
2. return plain code text without any formating and without any explanation
3. remove any 3 backticks or 3 fences or 3 backquotes that use to make the code look prettier on the response

IMPORTANT :
1. show only result of step 3
2. you do not need to tell what file that it generated, the only output that i need is plaint text code
2. We have broken up the program into per-file generation.
Now your job is to generate only the code for the file {filename} Make sure to have consistent filenames if you reference other files we are also generating.
Remember that you must obey 3 things:
   - you are generating code for the file {filename}
   - do not stray from the names of the files and the shared dependencies we have decided on
   - MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL - the purpose of our app is {question} - every line of code you generate must be valid code. example 
Bad response:
1. ```javascript
console.log('hello world')

Step :
1. Analyze the users intent and source code then divide the request by each target output, if it do not have any source code related to given request then make a guess be the request based on the project and create a filepath with the same structure.
2. Iterate on each request and put it into list of request to fix
3. then give me the list of [{"filepath":<filepath1>,"code_to_replace":<code_to_replace1>,"replacement_code":<replacement_code1>},{"filepath":<filepath2>,"code_to_replace":<code_to_replace2>,"replacement_code":<replacement_code2>}] so i can use the list object json to use this function 

for obj in output:
     replace_code(obj["filename"], obj["code_to_replace"], obj["fixed_code"])

make sure the code to replace is all the code it need to replace to make the replacement code work, 
If you want to change several lines of code from in argument 3 then in argument 2 target the lines of code related to argument 3 and replace them completely
like [{"filepath":"file1","code_to_replace":"file_attachment = fields.Binary(string=\'File Attachment\')","replacement_code":file_attachment = fields.Binary(string=\'File Attachment\')\ncategory = fields.Many2one(\'todo.task.category\', string=\'Category\')}],
and if the request want to create something then put new filepath base on the request and source code
4. output only the json

good response :

{"filepath":"<base on the filepath>","code_to_replace":"<another code to replace>","replacement_code":"<another replacement code>"},
{"filepath":"<base on the filepath>","code_to_replace":"<another code to replace>","replacement_code":"<another replacement code>"},
